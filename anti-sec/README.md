On June 30, 2017, I got this on my email:

_We received word that one of your repositories contains sensitive information that you may not have intended to make public such as email addresses, server information and other personal and confidential information of other users:

https://github.com/fdiskyou/Zines/blob/master/anti-sec/nowayout.txt_

So... I had to remove the file. Anyway, obviously you can still find it online: https://download.adamas.ai/dlbase/ezines/Anti-Sec/nowayout.txt
